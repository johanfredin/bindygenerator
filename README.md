# bindygenerator

Work in progress where you can create a Camel Bindy object from a csv file<br>
similar to how you can create a JAXB object from an .xsd file.

<p>
Typically, creating a bindy class takes zero time. But when you have a case<br>
where the file contains 20+ columns with cryptic names then this becomes less fun
